## Projects

### [VIX Futures & Volatility Term Structure Analysis](https://github.com/Nemonyte04/vix-futures-term_structure-analysis)
*Dec 2025 – Jan 2026*  
- Replicated Jablecki et al.’s volatility term-structure framework using updated VIX futures data (2014–2025 vs. original 2004–2015 period), and evaluated its behavior in recent market conditions.
- Developed and backtested three volatility trading strategies: VRP-based long/short VIX futures and a short-only VIX futures,and a novel forward volatility approach using term-structure slope signals for S&P 500 options; short-only VRP strategy achieved 20.4% CAGR with 0.85 Sharpe ratio.

### [2D Fluid Flow Simulation – Computational Fluid Dynamics Project](https://navier-stokes-namit.streamlit.app/)  
*Apr 2023 – Jun 2023*  
- Designed a numerical simulation of 2D fluid flow in a lid-driven cavity using vorticity–stream function formulation.  
- Employed finite difference methods and Jacobi iteration in Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib); extended framework to include flow disturbances.  
- Developed a **Streamlit interface** for interactive variable control and time-step adjustment.

## Experience

**Computational Modeling & Semiconductor Engineering Research Assistant**  
*Intel CAFE & Rajan Group, The Ohio State University | May 2025 – Jul 2025*  
- Modeled and simulated quantum tunneling currents for semiconductor device stacks in Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas); generalized models for arbitrary stacks.  
- Built lab’s first photodetector bandwidth measurement system to inform faster optical communication device design.  
- Conducted market research on solar-blind photodetectors to evaluate commercial and engineering potential.  

**Data Analytics & Strategic Insights Intern**  
*Office for Advancement and Admissions, The College of Wooster | Mar 2025 – Jul 2025*  
- Automated alumni data processing into a unified scoring model for CRM system, reducing workflow time from 4 days to minutes.  
- Analyzed 95,000 admissions inquiries to identify demographic trends; documented findings and informed outreach strategy adjustments.
